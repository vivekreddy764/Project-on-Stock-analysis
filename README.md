# Problem Introduction
Two of India's biggest stock exchanges BSE and NSE, collectively clear trades combining to greater than 40,000 crores every day. As you might already be aware, a lot of trading happens on the basis of technical and fundamental analysis.
One of the most basic technical analysis used by a lot of stock traders is the Moving Average Method. 

Consider the following price trend of a particular stock.

Week 1: 13,14,11,17,19

Week 2: 26,23,22,22,14

Week 3: 17,19,13,16,17

As you can see, moving average uses the past data to smoothen the price curve. For the purpose of this assignment, you will be using 20 day and 50 day moving averages.
Now that you know about the concept of moving average, you shall be wondering how to use it to determine whether to buy or sell a stock.

When the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average, it is a signal to BUY, as it indicates that the trend is shifting up. This is known as a Golden Cross.

function that gives the signal on giving the date as an input..

3.While coming to the stock analysis to give brief about that lets
take an example of Bajaj stock exchange the moving average of
the stock price can tell the price of the stock â€¦. Graph is plotted
to reference the stock signal.. 

4.It can be noted from the data when the golden cross
appears it is best time to buy a stock as the cost price of
stock started increasing in coming days hence increasing in
